# Laser cutter 
#### By @Rikhav
## Day 1
So today I mainly ust worked on research took an inventory on parts that I had, and sort of thought about how to build this thing. I found something really cool where someone [attatches a laser cutter to their A1 mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/1oi44fl/i_turned_my_bambu_a1_mini_into_a_mini_laser_cutter/) so I was thinking that I can domehitn gsimilar to that. Today I was mainly looking at wiring, how I would actually do it, adustability etc.

Total time spent : 3 and a half hours.
## Day 2
So today I went more down the laser cutting rabit hole and actually saw different designs that people implemented. I decided that it would probably be better if I modded mmy custom printer (inspired by the 100) instead of my bambu labs, because I ust know how it works a lot better. However, I also did realize that my laser does operate at a different voltage than the rest of my printer so I am going to have to use a seperate PSU for that. I also loked more into the mounting solutions, and I decided on a 3d printed bracket that can hold a sliding frame.
