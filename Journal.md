# Laser cutter 
#### By @Rikhav
## Day 1
So today I mainly ust worked on research took an inventory on parts that I had, and sort of thought about how to build this thing. I found something really cool where someone ![attatches a laser cutter to their A1 mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/1oi44fl/i_turned_my_bambu_a1_mini_into_a_mini_laser_cutter/) so I was thinking that I can domehitn gsimilar to that. Today I was mainly looking at wiring, how I would actually do it, adustability etc.
Total time spent : 3 and a half hours.
